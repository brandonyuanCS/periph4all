Dataset notes:
- the dataset used is a modified version of a public kaggle dataset
- filtered based on DPI, IPS, weight, brand to reduce size from 1200+ to ~450
- used ScraperAPI to get the pricing data (this is gonna take 1-2 hours)
- manually removed mice with fishy prices
- manually slimmed down dataset to avoid duplicate models and reduce brand bias

Columns we might want:
- price (IMPORTANT)
- release date
