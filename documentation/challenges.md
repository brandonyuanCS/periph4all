Challenging things that sucked

- (BIGGEST CHALLENGE) dataset configuration, specificallys scraping mouse prices
- setting hard filters vs vector embedding params
    - e.g. price is hard filter, shape is param
- inconsistent response from Groq
    - sometimes doesn't ask questions
    - sometimes skips questions
    - sometimes tweaks out
- avoiding bias in semantic embeddings
    - e.g. if mouse has "wireless" in its name, might consider it a very close match if looking for wireless mice
